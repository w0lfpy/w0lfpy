Hi, I'm Jose Suarez python developer and cybersecurity lover. I'm currently a student of Software Development Engineering in Madrid, at the same time I do my own projects!!! I've been passionate about the world of cybersecurity for a long time, that's why I'm continuously training to improve my skills and get certifications. 
I am also passionate about economics and financial markets to which I have been working for more than 5 years. I am on my way to unite my two passions and I want to make you participants, so I invite you to follow me and do not miss any of the work that I'm doing that will be in this same profile!!!
